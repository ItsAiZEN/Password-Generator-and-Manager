# Password-Generator-and-Manager

A simple password generator and manager with interactive GUI. Made using Python and Tkinter

The generator lets you choose length and character types for the needed password.

You can save passwords and log-in infomation through the program (FYI, while the program "pickles" the content it is not hashed nor encrypted on your computer).

The code implements basic Object-Oriented Programming, Unit-Testing and use of Regular Expressions.
